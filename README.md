#Keeper Web App 

"Inspired" by Google Keep, this web app was created to allow users to add/remove notes. The web app was implemented using React.js with Material-UI. 

To run this:
- clone/download the repo
- from terminal write: `npm i` 
- once all the dependencies have successfully installed, write `npm start` to start the react application.
